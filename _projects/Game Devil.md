Game Devil is my personal overscoped project about a personal narrative I created about some stuff that happened with me and some people extrapolated systemically to the games industry while also paying homage to my favorite stuffs in games (like words and dialogue) and style and yeah I want to make Game Development Disco Elysium by way of Persona 5.
