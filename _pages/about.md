## Welcome to my **super-cool** site!


***
Note: I'm building this site out slowly. Some stuff might still be from the template lol.

***
##### Quick Navigation
- If you arrived here from a work thing, you might be looking for my [CV]({% link _pages/cv.md %}).

- Check out the Games that I've worked on, and even **play some of them**, right on the browser like cool sites used to do (IF I HAVE GOTTEN THE WEBGLS UP ALREADY, otherwise I'm working on it).

Check out my **Blog** for literally all kinds of things I write about.

This is all this is for now. But stay tuned.

##### **Pro tip: Press Ctrl+K for a super-cool super-hacker search**
