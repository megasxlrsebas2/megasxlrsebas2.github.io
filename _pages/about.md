## Welcome to my **super-cool** site!

##### This is a total mess but there's loads of fun stuff. Like the websites _used_ to be.


***


If you arrived here from a work thing, you might be looking for my [CV]({% link _pages/cv.md %}) and my **Portfolio**


Go play some **Games** that I've made, right on the browser like cool sites used to do.

Check out my **Blog** for literally all kinds of things I write about.

This is all this is for now. But stay tuned.
